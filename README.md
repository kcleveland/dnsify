# dnsify
Simple REST-based API for Bind DNS servers. It currently supports PUT, POST, and DELETE operations to add, update, and remove entries from a Bind DNS setup.

## Instructions
Tested on Ubuntu 14.x LTS. This API can be run locally on the master bind server itself (supports master/slaves as well) or remotely on another server. You must first install ruby and use gem to install the sinatra and json gems.

Example Bind configuration files have been provided to help facilitate getting started using this API with a Bind DNS server.

## DNSify RESTful API
The API currently supports PUT, POST, and DELETE methods to add, update, and delete entries from DNS. On successful PUT a 201 is returned, on successful POST or DELETE a 200 is returned. Duplicate entries will not be created and will result in a 500 error returned.

<b>PUT</b>
A PUT request is used to create a new record in DNS. DNSify will create entries in both the forward and reverse zone files on successful PUT. A 201 is returned on success, otherwise a 500 error is returned.

<b>POST</b>
