# dnsify
Simple REST-based API for Bind DNS servers. It currently supports PUT, POST, and DELETE operations to add, update, and remove entries from a Bind DNS setup.

## Instructions
Tested on Ubuntu 14.x LTS. This API can be run locally on the master bind server itself (supports master/slaves as well) or remotely on another server. You must first install ruby and use gem to install the sinatra and json gems.
<pre>
ruby dns.rb
</pre>
Example Bind configuration files have been provided to help facilitate getting started using this API with a Bind DNS server.

## DNSify RESTful API
The API currently supports PUT, POST, and DELETE methods to add, update, and delete entries from DNS. On successful PUT a 201 is returned, on successful POST or DELETE a 200 is returned. Duplicate entries will not be created and will result in a 500 error returned.

<b>PUT</b>
A PUT request is used to create a new record in DNS. DNSify will create entries in both the forward and reverse zone files on successful PUT. A 201 is returned on success, otherwise a 500 error is returned if the entry already exists or if there was another problem.
<pre>
curl -i -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'X-Api-Key: secret' -d '{ "hostname": "hosty.xlabs.avaya.com", "ip": "10.130.124.24" }' http://localhost:4567/dns
</pre>

<b>POST</b>
A POST request is used to update/change an existing DNS entry (can change either IP or hostname for an existing entry). On successful POST a 200 is returned, otherwise a 500 error is returned if the entry does not exist or if there was another problem.
<pre>
curl -i -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'X-Api-Key: secret' -d '{ "hostname": "hosttest.xlabs.avaya.com", "ip": "10.130.124.23" }' http://localhost:4567/dns
</pre>

<b>DELETE</b>
A DELETE request is used to delete an existing DNS entry. On successful DELETE a 200 is returned, otherwise a 500 error is returned if the entry to delete to does not exist or if there was another problem.
<pre>
curl -i -X DELETE -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'X-Api-Key: secret' -d '{ "hostname": "hosttest.xlabs.avaya.com", "ip": "10.130.124.23" }' http://localhost:4567/dns
</pre>
